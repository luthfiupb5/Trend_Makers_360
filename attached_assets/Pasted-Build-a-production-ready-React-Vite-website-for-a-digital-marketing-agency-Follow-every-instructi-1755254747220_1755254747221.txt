Routing

Use React Router v6 with code-splitting via React.lazy for all pages. Include a 404 route. Ensure scroll-to-top on route change.

Global UI & Layout Rules

Sticky header with translucent/blurred background; ensure it does not overlap anchor targets (add scroll-margin-top).

Mobile nav drawer with the same links as desktop + two CTAs: “Book Strategy Call” and “WhatsApp Us”.

Buttons: rounded-xl, gradient background, hover: slight lift + gradient shift.

Spacing & rhythm: Tailwind’s container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8, generous py-16 sections.

Images: every <img> uses loading="lazy" + descriptive alt.

Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast; visible focus states; aria labels for nav/drawer/slider/accordions.

Navigation (exact labels/links)

Home /

Services /services (with subpages)

Portfolio /portfolio

Case Studies /case-studies

About /about

Blog /blog

Contact /contact

Header right CTAs:

Book Strategy Call → # (placeholder)

WhatsApp Us → https://wa.me/91XXXXXXXXXX (placeholder)

SEO Requirements (must implement all)

Per-page unique: <title>, <meta name="description">, canonical, OG, Twitter card using react-helmet-async within a reusable <SEO /> component.

Hreflang: default en-IN (prepare for ta-IN later).

JSON-LD (valid syntax) via <script type="application/ld+json">:

Organization with "@type": "AdvertisingAgency": name, url, logo, sameAs (placeholders), contactPoint, areaServed (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh), foundingDate, email, telephone, address (Chennai placeholder).

BreadcrumbList on all interior pages.

Service for each service subpage.

FAQPage on Home (or dedicated FAQ section on Home).

Article for blog posts; Case study page uses Article with "articleSection": "Case Study".

Open Graph / Twitter: title, description, canonical, og:image (use /og/og-default.jpg), og:type, twitter:card=summary_large_image.

Sitemap: create /src/lib/sitemap.js to output /public/sitemap.xml listing ALL routes. Include lastmod and priority.

robots.txt: in /public/robots.txt referencing https://www.trendmakers360.in/sitemap.xml. Allow all.

Performance: preconnect to Google Fonts, font-display: swap, lazy-load images, code-split routes, use Tailwind for lean CSS.

Analytics placeholder: add GA4 snippet placeholder in index.html (commented).

PWA basics: manifest.webmanifest with name, theme color, icons.

QA checks: All CTAs link, sticky header doesn’t overlap, images have meaningful alt text, meta tags are unique per page.

Styles (Tailwind)

Configure Tailwind; use a gradient utility class, e.g.:

bg-gradient-to-tr from-[#000080] to-[#00bfff]

Use text-[#0B1220] for body, lots of white space.

Utilities for scroll-margin-top on heading anchors (to avoid sticky overlap).

Reusable <SEO /> Component (spec)

Props: title, description, path, ogImage, jsonLd

Computes:

const url = 'https://www.trendmakers360.in' + path

Adds <link rel="canonical" href={url} />

Adds meta for description, OG, Twitter

Renders <script type="application/ld+json">{jsonLd}</script> when provided

Default ogImage = /og/og-default.jpg
